# eROI
- eROI method systematically converts raw datasets into structured matrices with
standardized dimensions, effectively preserving m/z reading for subsequent analytical
phases.

# Cite
- Equidistant regions of interest-multivariate curve resolution for clean spectra from
plant-metabolomics by gas chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry

# Requirements for eROI operation 
- The required input data format is mzML.
- Python, version 3.7 or greater
- Windows 10 or greater

# Usage
- First, download the exe program and double-click to open it. Choose the language according to your preference.
- Next, select the location of the mzML file, then input the scan points per minute, m/z range, and RI range.
- Afterward, click "Next" to choose the output file save location.
- Once all parameters are set, click "Run" and wait for the process to complete. The results will be available afterward.
